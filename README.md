Title: Smart attendance using face recognition

This IOT project enabled me to use ESP-32 cam module, through which we have scanned few faces and their details are stored in google docs. Later, when ever the cam module scanned any face ,his/her name and corresponding entry and exit time of that person was recorded automatically and the details of that person and timings were mentioned in the google docs simultaneously. This way we have achieved the smart attendance using face recognition.
